100 days of swiftUI

Day One : Variables, constants, strings, and numbers
    Good review of how to use in swift. Learned 3 things:
        1. Underscore as comma when using numbers
        2. Convert to add float and int 
        3. Multi-line strings
       
Day Two : Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums
    Was having a hard time until I started experimenting using what I learned.
    Had the most fun playing around with enums and assigning values.
    Still struggling with dictionary and sets syntax but seem to have a basic understanding on when to use each and how.
