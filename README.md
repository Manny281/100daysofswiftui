100 days of swiftUI

Day One : Variables, constants, strings, and numbers
    Good review of how to use in swift. Learned 3 things:
        1. Underscore as comma when using numbers
        2. Convert to add float and int 
        3. Multi-line strings
       
(for day 2 I accidentally did day two of 100 days of swift instead of the SwiftUi Version, so technically this is day 3 learning material)

Day Two : Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums
    Was having a hard time until I started experimenting using what I learned.
    Had the most fun playing around with enums and assigning values.
    Still struggling with dictionary and sets syntax but seem to have a basic understanding on when to use each and how.
    
(Day 3 is technically doing day 2 and redoing day 3 in the proper section)

Day Three: Arrays, dictionaries, sets and enums PLUS real day 2 stuff : Booleans, string interpolation
    After redoing the arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums in the correct section i felt it was taught better and had a better and deeper understanding of the different ways to use them.
    Booling and string interpolation felt more like a review because of my basic understanding on those things already. 
    The checkpoint / mini code challenge was fun. At first i overcomplicated it trying to get user input and creating an empty variable. After just breaking it down, it was only 3 lines of code and very simple. I need to get used to logical thinking and maybe go back and review my old book on programming logic.

Day Four: type annotations and checkpoint 2 :
    Learned multiple ways to write the same line of code using explicit type and inference type . Explicit type is mainly used for empty variables/arrays or any of the rest. It can also be a personal preference. inference type if faster to write and could appear simpler and easier to change variable to a different type. Unless you need to use a certain type its a person preference.

    The coding challenge was simple. I wrote half the code then I couldnt figure out how to only print the unique items number. I knew that sets doesn't use duplicates but i got confused when it was asking to create array. It was just me overthinking again. I then read the hint and relearned that i could create a set from an array so i made a set using the array and printed the unique items with count.

Day Five: Conditions:
    Learned mutliple ways to write conditions; If , switch, and ternary.
    I played around with the ones that i wasn't so sure about to see how they work and to make sure i could actually use them to write code. The main thing i was wondering is when to use each one and i now have a basic understanding of when. This lesson took a lot longer because i spent a lot of time playing around with what i had learned.
