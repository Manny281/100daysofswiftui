100 days of swiftUI

Day One : Variables, constants, strings, and numbers
    Good review of how to use in swift. Learned 3 things:
        1. Underscore as comma when using numbers
        2. Convert to add float and int 
        3. Multi-line strings
       
(for day 2 I accidentally did day two of 100 days of swift instead of the SwiftUi Version, so technically this is day 3 learning material)

Day Two : Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums
    Was having a hard time until I started experimenting using what I learned.
    Had the most fun playing around with enums and assigning values.
    Still struggling with dictionary and sets syntax but seem to have a basic understanding on when to use each and how.
    
(Day 3 is technically doing day 2 and redoing day 3 in the proper section)

Day Three: Arrays, dictionaries, sets and enums PLUS real day 2 stuff : Booleans, string interpolation
    After redoing the arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums in the correct section i felt it was taught better and had a better and deeper understanding of the different ways to use them.
    Booling and string interpolation felt more like a review because of my basic understanding on those things already. 
    The checkpoint / mini code challenge was fun. At first i overcomplicated it trying to get user input and creating an empty variable. After just breaking it down, it was only 3 lines of code and very simple. I need to get used to logical thinking and maybe go back and review my old book on programming logic.
