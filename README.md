100 days of swiftUI

Day One : Variables, constants, strings, and numbers
    Good review of how to use in swift. Learned 3 things:
        1. Underscore as comma when using numbers
        2. Convert to add float and int 
        3. Multi-line strings
       
(for day 2 I accidentally did day two of 100 days of swift instead of the SwiftUi Version, so technically this is day 3 learning material)

Day Two : Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums
    Was having a hard time until I started experimenting using what I learned.
    Had the most fun playing around with enums and assigning values.
    Still struggling with dictionary and sets syntax but seem to have a basic understanding on when to use each and how.
    
(Day 3 is technically doing day 2 and redoing day 3 in the proper section)

Day Three: Arrays, dictionaries, sets and enums PLUS real day 2 stuff : Booleans, string interpolation
    After redoing the arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums in the correct section i felt it was taught better and had a better and deeper understanding of the different ways to use them.
    Booling and string interpolation felt more like a review because of my basic understanding on those things already. 
    The checkpoint / mini code challenge was fun. At first i overcomplicated it trying to get user input and creating an empty variable. After just breaking it down, it was only 3 lines of code and very simple. I need to get used to logical thinking and maybe go back and review my old book on programming logic.

Day Four: type annotations and checkpoint 2 :
    Learned multiple ways to write the same line of code using explicit type and inference type . Explicit type is mainly used for empty variables/arrays or any of the rest. It can also be a personal preference. inference type if faster to write and could appear simpler and easier to change variable to a different type. Unless you need to use a certain type its a person preference.

    The coding challenge was simple. I wrote half the code then I couldnt figure out how to only print the unique items number. I knew that sets doesn't use duplicates but i got confused when it was asking to create array. It was just me overthinking again. I then read the hint and relearned that i could create a set from an array so i made a set using the array and printed the unique items with count.

Day Five: Conditions:
    Learned mutliple ways to write conditions; If , switch, and ternary.
    I played around with the ones that i wasn't so sure about to see how they work and to make sure i could actually use them to write code. The main thing i was wondering is when to use each one and i now have a basic understanding of when. This lesson took a lot longer because i spent a lot of time playing around with what i had learned.

    
Day Six : Loops
    Learned about for loops, how to nest them, and range operators. I felt like i had a pretty good understanding and passed the test. Also learned while loops and how they run until the conditon is false. I felt like i had a good understanding but i ended up failing most of the questions on the test. I lost all motivation because i thought i was understanding it but i just kept pushing through. Then when to use break and continue and how they work. 
    When i got to checkpoint 3 for the coding challenge i was able to write the code fairly quick without having to look at the hints . That made me feel excited even thought it eas something so simple to me it felt like a big deal. The main reason being that i failed the test section but i was able to write the code on my own.

Day Seven: Functions Part One
    Learned about functions and using them when code needs to be repeated throughout. Then using parameters to accept inputm returning values, and customizing parameter labels by using underscore or adding a second name. I had fun with this section playing around and writing code with what i had learned. Functions used to look so confusing but not as bad as i made it seem, so far that is. I was able to complete the mini challenge and rewrote some of the earlier code as functions that accept parameters.

Day Eight: Functions Part Two
    Today i learned how to handle errors in the functions by defining them in an enum and using do, try and catch. Another section of the lesson creating default values in teh parameter of the function.

    I was pretty confident writing the code for the checkpoint challenge but after i completed it i realized i did the math part wrong. Then once corrected, i was able to get it to print what i wanted it to, but instead of of printing the error of no root i would get a zero instead. (when i had the math wrong it would print the error). After giving up , since this all new to me, i looked at the solution and i guess i just overcomplicated the code and realized what i was doing wrong.

    Over time and with more practice i will write cleaner code, stop overthinking, and be able to break down the code step by step writing pseudocode if i need to.

Day Nine: Closures
    Tpday i learned about how to make and use closures and why they are important to know about in swift. After creating the closure started with accpeting parameters then returning values. Trailing closure is one of the things i am currently stuck on. I can write simple stuff but accepting functions in the parameters keeps confusing me. I start to feel like i am understanding it then again im stuck all over again. 

    I am currently having a hard time with some of the things so i will do more research and practice messing around with each thing i learn to get a better understanding. I hard a hard time doing the challenge but once i saw the solution i could read what was going on i just couldnt create that myself. 

Day Ten: Structs Part one
	I learned how to create structs and using mutating to be able to change constants within. Used compute property to automatically compute the values each time it is called. Then I used observers didSet and willSet to run pieces of code before and when the property is changed. The final thing I learned today was how to create custom initializers and how to customize them.

Day 11 : structs part 2 ; Access Control, Computed Properties, Methods & checkpoint 6
	Today I learned about access control and why it’s useful and how it can be applied variables . Then I learned about static properties and methods with some examples on when and how to use static.  The challenge wasn’t too hard using what I had learned but my solution was very different from the course solution. 

Day 12: Classes & checkpoint 7 
    Today I learned about classes and how they differ from strict. I learned how to add initializers and how a deinitializer works. The most important thing I learned about classes was how they inherit properties and methods from parent classes. 
	
    The challenge felt pretty simple because I understood the lessons better than I understood the past few days plus I have been looking through apples soft documentation to get a deeper understanding of what I have been learning . I will also dig deeper into computer science to get an even deeper understanding of it . I put web development on hold and spend up to 8 hours learning swift and practicing code because I am most excited about creating apps and working with iOS.     

Day 13 : Protocols and extensions & checkpoint 8 
    Today I learned about Protocol, extensions, protocol extensions and the basics of how opaque return types work. No I have a basic understanding about how protocols and extensions work as well as when and why to use each one . The challenge for checkpoint 8 felt easy to complete and I was able to write the code for it fairly quickly. After completing each day I usually spend about an hour looking through Apple swift documentation to get a better understanding and even if I don’t remember I will know where I can go to look for specific syntax 

Day 14 : Optionals & Checkpoint 9
	Today I learned about optionals . Then how to unwrap optionals using multiple ways such as guard and nil coalescing. I also learned how to chain multiple options together. There is an alternative to do, try and catch using optionals to handle errors from a function.

	The challenge wasn’t too hard even though though I only seen to understand them very little. I will spend the rest of tonight looking through the Swift documentation to get a better understanding of some of the topics I was struggling with. I know I probably won’t remember everything but I just want to understand where to use it when I need it.

Day 15 : Wwift Review
